			<h2 class="title">About</h2>	
        		<p><br>Hello! I am a recent graduate of San Diego State University in Computer Science. I have always been fascinated with technology and how it drives the world around us. Now more than ever, we are able to use technology to push our innovative boundaries, and I am excited to contribute to this growing field. Recently, I have started getting into web development, with more emphasis on front-end development.<br><br>Prior to beginning college, I played four years of professional baseball as an infielder in the Miami Marlins organization. Not only was it a great experience, but I learned many valuable life lessons along the way. Through baseball I learned that nothing comes easy, and that having a strong work ethic is essential for success. This mentality has carried over into my everyday life, making me strive to be the best at whatever I do.<br><br>While I understand the value of being driven, I also know how important it is to find a balance between work and fun. When I have free time, I enjoy working out, biking, backpacking, golfing, enjoying the great craft beer in San Diego, and various art projects.</p>

					<div class="subtitle"><b>Raspberry Pi Smart Room</b></div><p>I am currently working on this project. My goal for this project is to make an electronic, wall-mounted calendar and notification center using an old laptop screen. I am currently able to synchronize my Google calendar and other notifications, such as the weather, using a web server and my Raspberry Pi. In addition to this, I would also like to add voice activation capabilities to control the lights in my room or other various tasks. If I am able to implement this, I may add motion detection functionality to the system to conserve energy when nobody is present in the room.</p>

					<div class="subtitle"><b>Web Development</b></div><p>My first introduction into web development was when I had to make a website for my honor society at school. Because of tight time constraints, I opted to use a product called Adobe Muse. Although this program did not require me to code much in HTML, I learned many valuable skills, such as how to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and how to design a website. Since then, I have built two websites from scratch. I have used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop this portfolio site, along with a <a href="http://mpasekbaseball.com" target="_blank"><i>website</i></a> for baseball lessons. I am currently learning how to build more dynamic websites using PHP, jQuery, and other frameworks.</p>

					<div class="subtitle"><b>Furniture / Home Decoration</b></div><p>One of the things I enjoy most is being able to create something from nothing. One of my hobbies is making furniture or other home decoration pieces. I just recently built a desk for myself using industrial steel pipe. I have also built a pallet wood and mason jar planter, as well as a coffee table and dining table for my brother and sister-in-law.</p>

					<div class="subtitle"><b>Artwork</b></div><p>In addition to building furniture, I also enjoy making art pieces. My favorite (and most time consuming) piece is one I made back in 2013. Using a $10 wood-burning tool, I burned a lion head onto a piece of plywood. Another piece I made was the California bear flag, spray-painted onto reclaimed fence boards.</p>
