				<div class="content">
					<h2 class="title">About</h2>
					<p><br>Hello! I am Software Engineer from San Diego, CA who recently picked up and moved to Sydney, Australia
						on a Work Holiday Visa. It was a huge step for me to leave everything I know and move halfway around the
						world. However, I am extremely excited for this new adventure, and to meet many incredible people along
						the way. I'm not really sure what to expect this next year, but I would love to land a position that allows me
						to explore this beautiful city and country for more than just a year. I know the tech industry in Sydney is growing
						rapidly, and I would love to be able to contribute to its growth.
						<br><br>
						Now a little about myself. I played four years of professional baseball as an infielder in the Miami Marlins
						organization prior to beginning college. Not only was it a great experience, but I learned many valuable life
						lessons along the way. Through baseball I learned that nothing comes easy, and that having a strong work ethic
						is essential for success. This mentality has carried over into my everyday life, making me strive to be the best
						at whatever I do.
						<br><br>
						While I understand the value of being driven, I also know how important it is to find a balance between work and
						fun. In my spare time, I enjoy working out, biking, backpacking, golfing, building things, doing art projects, enjoying the
						great craft beer in San Diego, going to music events and festivals, and mimosa Sundays.

						<div class="subtitle">RASPBERRY PI SMART ROOM</div>
						<p>This project is still in progress. My goal for the project was to make an electronic, wall-mounted
							calendar and notification center using an old laptop screen and a Raspberry Pi. I am currently able
							to synchronize my Google calendar and other notifications, such as the weather, using a web server
							and my Raspberry Pi. I would eventually like to add voice activation capabilities to control the
							lights in my room or other various tasks.

						<div class="subtitle">WEB DEVELOPMENT</div>
						<p>My first introduction into web development was when I had to make a website for my honor society at
							school. Because of tight time constraints, I opted to use a product called Adobe Muse. Although this
							program did not require me to code much in HTML, I learned many valuable skills, such as how to use
							Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and how to design a website. Since then, I have built two websites
							from scratch. I have used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop this portfolio site,
							along with a <a href="http://mpasekbaseball.com" target="_blank"><i>website</i></a> for baseball lessons.
							<br><br>
							I am currently in the process of trying to create a web application that uses both the Spotify and Soundcloud
							APIs to allow users to create playlists with songs from either site. I intend for this to be a social app that
							allows friends to share playlists/mixes with one another. This will be my first app using the MEAN
							stack.<br><br>

						<div class="subtitle">FURNITURE / HOME DECORATION</div>
						<p>One of the things I enjoy most is being able to create something from nothing. One of my hobbies is making
							furniture or other home decoration pieces. I just recently built a desk for myself using industrial steel
							pipe. I have also built a pallet wood and mason jar planter, as well as a coffee table and dining table
							for my brother and sister-in-law.

						<div class="subtitle">ARTWORK</div>
						<p>In addition to building furniture, I also enjoy making art pieces. My favorite (and most time consuming)
							piece is one I made back in 2013. Using a $10 wood-burning tool, I burned a lion head onto a piece of
							plywood. Another piece I made was the California bear flag, spray-painted onto reclaimed fence boards.
