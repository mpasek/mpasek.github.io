				<div class="content">
					<h2 class="title">About</h2>
					<p><br>Hello! I am Software Engineer from San Diego, CA who recently picked up and moved to Sydney, Australia
						on a Work Holiday Visa. It was a huge step for me to leave everything I know and move halfway around the
						world. However, I am extremely excited for this new adventure, and to meet many incredible people along
						the way. I'm not really sure what to expect this next year, but I would love to land a position that allows me
						to explore this beautiful city and country for more than just a year. I know the tech industry in Sydney is growing
						rapidly, and I would love to be able to contribute to its growth.
						<br><br>
						Now a little about myself. I played four years of professional baseball as an infielder in the Miami Marlins
						organization prior to beginning college. Not only was it a great experience, but I learned many valuable life
						lessons along the way. Through baseball I learned that nothing comes easy, and that having a strong work ethic
						is essential for success. This mentality has carried over into my everyday life, making me strive to be the best
						at whatever I do.
						<br><br>
						While I understand the value of being driven, I also know how important it is to find a balance between work and
						fun. In my spare time, I enjoy working out, biking, backpacking, golfing, building things, doing art projects, enjoying the
						great craft beer in San Diego, going to music events and festivals, and mimosa Sundays.

						<div class="subtitle">WEB DEVELOPMENT</div>
						<p>I just recently completed a web application using the MEAN stack utilizing the Spotify Developer API.
							The site is called <a href="http://www.aggregatr.co" target="_blank"><i>AGGREGATR</i></a> and it generates
							playlists based off the dates that users saved tracks to their library.
							I built the site using Angular 5 and Bootstrap on the frontend, while using NodeJS, Express, and
							MongoDB Atlas on the backend. I deployed the client-side code to an AWS S3 bucket while using an AWS
							EC2 instance for my server. Authentication is handled on the server-side using OAuth 2.0.
						</p><br>
						<img class="lrg-pic" src="Pics/aggregatr-home.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<img class="lrg-pic" src="Pics/aggregatr-preview.png"><br><br>

						<p>Some of my past work include developing websites for my honor society in college, this portfolio website,
							and another <a href="http://www.mpasekbaseball.com" target="_blank"><i>personal baseball lessons website</i></a>
							These sites were created using HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. After running into some issues on the first two sites
							regarding screen resolution and resizing, I decided to use Bootstrap for my baseball site. This greatly helped
							with dynamic resizing of the site.

						<div class="subtitle">RASPBERRY PI SMART ROOM</div>
						<p>This project is still in progress. My goal for the project was to make an electronic, wall-mounted
							calendar and notification center using an old laptop screen and a Raspberry Pi. I am currently able
							to synchronize my Google calendar and other notifications, such as the weather, using a web server
							and my Raspberry Pi. I would eventually like to add voice activation capabilities to control the
							lights in my room or other various tasks.

						<div class="subtitle">FURNITURE / HOME DECORATION</div>
						<p>One of the things I enjoy most is being able to create something from nothing. One of my hobbies is making
							furniture or other home decoration pieces. I just recently built two desk for myself; one using industrial steel
							pipe and reclaimed wood, another using steel hairpin legs. I have also built a pallet wood and mason jar planter,
							as well as a coffee table, dining table, and rustic wood headboard for my brother and sister-in-law.

						<div class="subtitle">ARTWORK</div>
						<p>In addition to building furniture, I also enjoy making art pieces. My favorite (and most time consuming)
							piece is one I made back in 2013. Using a $10 wood-burning tool, I burned a lion head onto a piece of
							plywood. Other pieces I have made include: the California bear flag, spray-painted onto reclaimed fence boards,
							and a wave design made with different sizes of maple wood triangles.
